#ArraysEx4.rb

arr = [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1]
arr.index(5)
#returns 3. This method only returns the index of the first value that returns true for the argument
arr.index[5]
#returns 5. This method returns the value of the index at that index.
#correct answer is that the method is undefined. Evidently you can't call an index for an index method. 
arr[5]
#returns 8. This should return the value at that index.
