#Here are the APIs that I accessed:
#https://github.com/hexgnu/linkedin

# The LinkedIn API I found seemed to allow access to a number of useful LinkedIn features. I had real problems with the site, though.
#The use cases were really poorly documented. There was little explanation of various methods or why a user would want to do the things described.

#http://developer.mailchimp.com/documentation/mailchimp/guides/get-started-with-mailchimp-api-3/
#This was my favorite API. It was well-documented with lots of definitions of different methods accessible by the user as well as examples of why one
#would actually want to do the things described. It felt very accessible.

#This one felt middle-of-the-road compared to the other two. There were some good definitions of ways to interact with the API, but 
# I didn't feel like I had a good sense for how or why you would want to do some of the things described.
